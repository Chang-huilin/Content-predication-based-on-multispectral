# Content Estimation Using Snapshot Multispectral Imaging Technology

This guide details the steps for estimating  content using snapshot multispectral imaging technology

## 1. Extract Reflectance Using HSI Software

- Use hyperspectral imaging (HSI) software to extract the reflectance data from the captured multispectral images.
- Ensure that the reflectance data is correctly preprocessed and calibrated for accurate analysis.

## 2. Read Multispectral .hdr File

- Read the multispectral image file in `.hdr` format using appropriate libraries (e.g., `spectral` library in Python).

## 3. Crop Region of Interest (ROI)

- Identify and crop the region of interest (ROI) from the multispectral image to focus on the relevant part for chlorophyll estimation.

## 4. Calculate Image Gray-Level Texture Features

- Compute gray-level texture features (e.g., contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity) from the ROI for analysis.

## 5. Algorithm Prediction

- Use a suitable algorithm (e.g., regression model, machine learning model) to predict the chlorophyll content based on the extracted features.

## 6. Plotting Results

- Visualize the results to interpret and analyze the predicted chlorophyll content.

By following these steps, you can estimate the chlorophyll content during the Tencha drying process using snapshot multispectral imaging technology and data fusion techniques.
